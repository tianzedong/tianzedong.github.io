                <h3>Agent Data-Flow Firewall</h3>
                <p>Designing a real-time interception layer that tags each agent tool call with a precise security tier, tracks data as it moves between tiers, and automatically blocks, masks, or downgrades any payload that violates flow rules. Building a Rust-based hybrid inspection engine that combines AWS Bedrock guardrails, LLM context analysis, and embedding-similarity comparisons against prior tool outputs to detect and flag data leaks in real time.</p>

                <h3>AI Agent for Electronic Health Records</h3>
                <p>Developed an AI agent serving as a natural language interface for Electronic Health Records, utilizing LangChain and Flask for the backend, React and TypeScript for the frontend, and Google BigQuery for data retrieval. Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by collecting over 500 natural language prompts from healthcare papers and creating corresponding SQL queries, which were stored in an embedding database using Chroma DB to serve as a few-shot demos repository for the model, improving text-to-SQL accuracy by 18%.</p>
